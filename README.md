# Palindrome String Checker in Java

## 📌 Overview
This project is a simple Java application that checks whether a given string is a **palindrome**.  
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. The program reverses the input string and compares it with the original string to determine whether it is a palindrome.

This task was completed as part of an **internship assignment** to strengthen fundamental Java programming skills.

## 🎯 Objective
- Write a Java program to check if a given string is a palindrome  
- Reverse the input string using a custom method  
- Compare the original and reversed strings  
- Display the result to the user  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Java**
- **Eclipse IDE**
- **Scanner class for user input**

---

## ⚙️ How the Program Works
1. Takes a string input from the user
2. Reverses the string character by character
3. Compares the reversed string with the original string
4. Prints whether the string is a palindrome or not
5. Ignores case sensitivity while comparison

---

## 🧩 Program Logic
- A loop is used to traverse the string from the last character to the first
- The reversed string is constructed by appending characters
- The `equalsIgnoreCase()` method is used to compare both strings
